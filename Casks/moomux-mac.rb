  # brew copies the downloaded image's quarantine record onto every
  # file of the installed bundle, so the first launch after *every*
  # install and upgrade is gated behind "Moomux is an app downloaded
  # from the Internet. Are you sure?" — nothing opens until someone
  # clicks through it, which reads as the app not launching. Worse
  # when the policy record for that path is stale (0.0.26, unstapled,
  # sat at /Applications): the process is spawned and killed ~2s
  # later with no window and, after the first time, no dialog either.
  #
  # The notarization ticket stapled *into* the bundle is what proves
  # provenance offline (see the Makefile's notarize target), so
  # dropping the xattr gives up nothing the staple isn't already
  # asserting — brew has already checked the image's sha256 against
  # the line above. , not the deprecated
  #  block; args are template-expanded, hence {{appdir}}.
